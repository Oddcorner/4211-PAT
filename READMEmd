# CS4211 PAT Volleyball Model Results

This repository contains the results of 100 games from the [NAIA](https://naiastats.prestosports.com/sports/wvball/2022-23/teams?sort=name&r=0&pos=) 2022 Womens volleyball season, and compares it to the predicted results from a custom model developed using the [Process Analysis Toolkit](https://pat.comp.nus.edu.sg/).

We found that the model was able to correctly predict the outcome of 67% of the games. These results can be viewed [here](https://github.com/Oddcorner/4211-PAT/blob/main/results.csv).

## Technologies

- [Process Analysis Toolkit](https://pat.comp.nus.edu.sg/)
- [Python 3.10.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3106/)

## Setup

To aid in the team composition setup to be used in the model (if you plan on modifying the starting player conditions), an python script to automate team setup is also included in this repository [here](https://github.com/Oddcorner/4211-PAT/blob/main/generator.py).

## Acknowledgments

Normalised team data found in [teams.csv](https://github.com/Oddcorner/4211-PAT/blob/main/teams.csv) was obtained throught the efforts of team member [@yusufaine](https://github.com/yusufaine/) in his [repository](https://github.com/yusufaine/4211-webscrape).
